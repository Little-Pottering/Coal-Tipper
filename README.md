This is my Arduino controlled automatic coal tipper.
Please note this is a work in progress and is a starting point for further development and adaptation to work with your particular coal house.   
A magnet is attached to the coal wagon which when it passes near the hall effect sensor, triggers the system.  



Components
Arduino nano or compatible.  
Hall effect sensor module
Button size or similar magnet x 1 (for fixing to coal wagon to trigger hall effect sensor)
Red led
Servo
